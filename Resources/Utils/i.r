         <9>    6Ð3Ð2005    pc      String numbering still problematic.
         <8>      6Ð3Ð05    pc      Correct problem with index numbering on Windows. Strange that RC
                                    didn't pick this up earlier.
         <7>     21Ð1Ð04    pc      Go to final status.
         <6>      8Ð1Ð04    pc      Modify for Rez/RC compatibility.
         <5>    6Ð7Ð2003    pc      Add STR# resource for Object List categories
         <4>    7Ð3Ð2003    pc      Bump version to final candidate.
         <3>  30Ð12Ð2002    pc      Use 'STR#' resource instead of faux 'Vers' resource for storing
                                    version information used at run-time. Also let version info
                                    indicate Classic/Carbon-savviness. Bump minor revision numbers. 
         <2>  29Ð11Ð2002    pc      Tidy up initial check in.
