Resource files used in building the Litter Power Objects

Although the factoring out of resources for objects has its roots in conventions that were mandated by Classic Mac OS
(and the Classic Mac OS resource-fork approach to file systems is no longer used on either Max OS X, never mind the
situation on Windows), the separation of actual executable code from strings, images, etc. is a sound principle. Note
that application development with Cocoa on Mac OS has an even stronger separation of code from resources, and Windows
development tools also factor these things apart.

One of the long-standing To-Dos for Litter Power has been to move the factoring of resources based around Classic 
Mac OS conventions to a more modern framework. The current state of the resources is something of a stop-gap measure
until that evolution can be made.
