These XCode Project files are, in the initial commit, example files that will need some modification to build objects.
A word of explanaiton:

Before Github, these XCode projects were at the top level of the Litter Power development directory and were designed
to use two main subdirectories: a Sources/ subdirectory (including the subdirectories Chaos, Continuous, etc., which
are all now directly at the top level of the Git repository).

The XCode projects are not for the most current version of XCode anyway, so developers working on Mac OS versions will
need to let XCode update the projects, and there some further modification may be necessary (if previous updates are
anything to go by). Probably the most efficient strategy would be to update the projects to work directly with the
current repository directory hierarchy.

It will be apparent on perusal that the original project organization did not follow the one-object-one-project model
used by the examples in the Max SDK. That was found to be bulky when developing many dozens of related Max objects.
In the very early days of developing Litter Power, there had been an attempt to maintain all objects within a single
project (this was in the days of CodeWarrior). That other extreme also proved to be inefficient. The compromise found
was to have a small number of projects, each containing a manageable number of projects for closely related objects.
Each XCode project maps to one source code directory and one resources directory. And the XCode projects all use a certain
amount of common code located in the LitterLib subdirectory.
