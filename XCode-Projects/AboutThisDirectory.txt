These XCode Project files are, in the initial commit, example files that will need some modification to build objects.
A word of explanaiton:

Before Github, these XCode projects were at the top level of the Litter Power development directory and were designed
to use two main subdirectories: a Sources/ subdirectory (including the subdirectories Chaos, Continuous, etc., which
are all now directly at the top level of the Git repository).

The XCode projects are not for the most current version of XCode anyway, so developers working on Mac OS versions will
need to let XCode update the projects, and there some further modification may be necessary (if previous updates are
anything to go by). Probably the most efficient strategy would be to update the projects to work directly with the
current repository directory hieerarchy.
